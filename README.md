The **Bambara ASR Leaderboard** is a collaborative benchmark for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on Bambara, a low-resource African language spoken primarily in Mali. It promotes innovation in ASR for underrepresented languages, supporting the mission: *"No Malian Language Left Behind"*.

This repository hosts the source code for the leaderboard application, deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with results persisted via GitHub for reliability.



## Dataset

Evaluations use the  **[Bambara ASR Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MALIBA-AI/bambara-speech-recognition-leaderboard)** dataset:
- **Language**: Bambara
- **Task**: ASR
- **Characteristics**: Diverse samples from multiple, accents, domains, and audio qualities.
- **Normalization**: Lowercase, remove punctuation, normalize whitespace.

**Submission Process**:
1. Access the test audio from the dataset.
2. Generate transcriptions.
3. Format as CSV (`id,text` matching dataset IDs).
4. Visit the [HF Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sudoping01/bam-asr-leaderboard).
4. Submit via the app's "Submit New Results" tab.

## Usage

- Visit the [HF Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sudoping01/bam-asr-leaderboard).
- Explore tabs: Leaderboard, Model Performance, Comparisons, Submissions, Dataset Info.
- Submit: Upload model name and CSV; scores computed automatically.
